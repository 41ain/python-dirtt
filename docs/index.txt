You can install it with ``easy_install dirtt``.


What It Does
------------

``dirtt`` is a standalone tool and library used to generate 
directory and file structures from xml templates that define 
a repeatedly used layout.

The general problem being tackled is one of inconsistent directory structures 
for visual effects projects, from a lack of industry standards, resulting in 
lost assets, security risks, and most importantly wasted resources from inefficient production.

``dirtt`` doesn't solve that problem directly. It provides a command-line
tool and python library that allow for quick creation of complex structures
from XML templates that define directory, file and link structures as well as
filesystem attributes and reference Cheetah templates for static file 
customizations.

The basic usage is::

    $ dirtt -t TEMPLATE.xml 

The templates that come with ``dirtt`` will not work out of the box as they
are templates themselves. They are intended to be parsed by some other method 
to replace the inherent template variables that create a custom structure.
Alternatively these can be easily edited to create working templates.


Contributing
------------

All kinds of contributions are welcome - code, tests, documentation, bug reports, ideas, etc.

Forking through Github
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First of all, you need to fork the the official repository, which is 
https://github.com/dshng/python-dirtt`_.

Log in to Github, go to the dirtt repository page, follow the fork link, 
wait for Github to copy the repository and then clone your fork, like:

$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USER_NAME/python-dirtt
Now you can change whatever you want, commit, push to your fork and when 
your contribution is done, follow the pull request link and send us a 
request explaining what you did and why.

Running the tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

dirtt's test suite is small and not yet at all comprehensive, but we aim
to grow it.

The easy way to run tests (handles test dependencies automatically)::

    $ python setup.py test
